I ended up watching a lot of movies in 2017 and I ended up really enjoying the majority of them.
It may not have been a good year financially for movies but it was definitely a good year
for new and interesting ideas put to film as well as fresh takes on existing material.
It was really tough to make my list of great movies and start eliminating them. A lot of
great movies had to be left out, but here are my top favorites in no particular order:

## Blade Runner 2049
Here is a movie I never thought would be any good. A sequel to a 30+ year old sci-fi movie
that never needed a sequel to begin with. Well, some kind of miracle happened where the right people all got together to make something really special. Denis Villeneuve is a phenomenal director (Enemy, Sicario, Prisoners, Arrival), but even that wasn't enough to temper my doubts going into this movie. Well, 2 hours and 44 minutes later I left the theatre very impressed. It was a beautiful combination of gorgeous cinematography, excellent sound design and score, and really strong performances. Just the color grading alone was excellent at setting a tone.

I think the most interesting part of Blade Runner 2049 was that you really don't need to see original to understand or appreciate this movie. In a way it is a very standalone movie, there are a few things, like Deckard, that tie back to the original but they are mostly explained in the continuity of this movie. It stands on it's own well and it doesn't do anything to retcon or hurt the original which is a nice plus. If you like hard sci-fi you should really do yourself a favor and check this one out.
